## Overview

The is my solution for the project calculator on the Odin Project.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathmatical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
- **Bonus**: Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- [JS](http://vanilla-js.com/) - Vanilla JS
- [Web APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API) 
- [DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model)

### What I learned

CSS variables combined with attribute selectors for custom themes :


```css
[theme=dark] {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme`:

```css

```


### Continued development

- refactor the code using ES6 class

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/calculator) - A good summary for what to be covered.
